2021 was footnoted with a significant moment. A moment that’s forced me to wonder what my next ten years might look like. So when someone on Twitter mentioned they were doing an end of year review, it struck a chord. I’ve followed suit, but extended the scope to ten years for reasons below.

The concluding moment to this particular decade was a bittersweet day of finally getting my Dad’s presumption of death order — the legal death certificate — after a lengthy ~~Zoom call~~ court hearing, with my brothers, our solicitor, and a judge. Going into what I thought would be a tick-box admin exercise triggered a range of feelings and memory jogs. Hearing the situation end-to-end from an earnest Judge was tough.

Given his death certificate will be dated back to 2012, it somehow rewrites the last ten years. I’ve been dealing with a father who was missing, and now also one who had simultaneously passed away. It made me ponder how much a piece of paper can change things and how one person — the Judge in this case — can state such things as fact. Of course, nothing has really changed, but for many years I saw little value in processing the death using official means. I’d made up my mind about what happened, what more did I need. But I can truly say I’m glad we have done it and owe thanks to my brother for driving this forward.

I’ve got used to telling the story about my Dad as if it all happened to someone else. I’ve only recently realised that I slipped into that coping mechanism over the 10 years he’s been missing.

Speaking of coping mechanisms, music has been the most incredible time machine. What a gift. I’ll opt in & out of this and treasure the fact I can ’go there’ when the need arises. I find whole albums are the best as somehow remembering what song comes next adds to the effect. Good on Adele for getting Spotify remove the default play mode being shuffle, for this reason.

How much has changed in ten years with the world and my own life would be amazing to explain to Dad. So perhaps writing some of this down, addressed to Dad, will be cathartic and help me hone the next decade.

- A few months after your disappearance, I met my wife (she’s great by the way)
- We’ve had two children (they’re great too), the second being born during a pandemic
- Oh yeah, there’s this pandemic going on
- We bought a house, selling the flat. That flat flooded really badly the week before our wedding and we ended up living in a Travelodge for 3 months like Alan Partridge. Thankfully we hadn’t had kids at this point
- After leaving R/GA - the last place you’ll know I was working (Aston Martin website), I have worked with some other agencies, Photobox, Songkick, Money Advice Service, DWP, Financial Times, Not on the High Street, Royal Navy, RAF, and Wayfair
- Colleagues and friends at R/GA were amazing at letting me deal with all this. Still in touch with many of them
- I’m still working through my own company on a consultancy basis. That’s been going on over 16 years now
- I’ve stopped playing the drums but still hope to bring that back one day
- Trained hard & done two half iron triathlons + a bunch of other events
- Bought an electric car - you’d like it even though it doesn’t make the same noises. They’re better than the Gee-Wizz which you’d probably be imagining
- Your mates still get in touch regularly to see if there’s any news
- Occasionally I’ve struggled with this whole thing, but I’ve been fine overall. Its gone from anger to sadness to anger to something resembling acceptance

# The next decade

All the places I’ve worked have been varied and have had learning curves. I sometimes question if my consultant way of working is the one I’ll keep long term. Am I limiting my career by doing so?

Perhaps, with all the background energy drain of the pandemic, processing Dad’s situation, not enough holidays, and the joyous-yet-exhausting rearing of an 18 month and 4 year old... it’s just... a lot.

So as a reminder to myself for the next ten years; recognise the difference between optional (self inflicted), and necessary pressure. Take more time off, you idiot. Keep being thankful for your friendships and amazing family. Take it easier.

Happy new decade.
