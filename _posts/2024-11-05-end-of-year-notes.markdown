Another eventful year trickles by. I enjoyed writing up my 'decade in review', but then did nothing similar to it for three years. Life is full of different challenges and _for sure_, writing out achievements and challenges are a useful strategy for reflection.

One debate that I seem to continuously have with myself is whether I should stay broaden my skills, or stay specialised. In fact I’ve been pondering on this for over ten years. I found an illustration I made back in 2012 when I was considering going into management during my time as a team lead. Its clearly something that’s not fully settled in my mind.

Nice problem to have? Possibly yes. A deeply considered strategy, including reflection over what motivates and brings joy is _continuously_ worth doing. In fact I hope to use this post as means to do that.

It reminds me of the [Hedgehog Concept by Jim Collins](https://medium.com/@slowwco/ikigai-vs-the-hedgehog-concept-by-jim-collins-the-same-or-different-420d3191b7be). Finding the intersection of:

- That which you love
- That which you are good at
- That which the world needs
- That which you can be paid for

## On skill oscillation

I’ve been feeling this particularly recently. Traditionally I’ve been a very focused individual and enjoyed confidence in either my practice, or my ability to pick up new aspects.

However, there is a point where there isn’t the capacity to maintain it. Childcare, increased responsibility across the whole equilibrium of life makes this particularly challenging.

Also, imposter syndrome never goes away. There is no level where it suddenly is all dealt with.

So with this preamble, I was thinking back to the specialist vs generalist debate. I have a bunch of them myself:

- specialist vs generalist
- music to technology
- backend to frontend development
- management to individual contributor

All of these could’ve been written in any order and are regularly going back & forth.

So, they oscillate! And what else oscillates? Sound. And what do I do? Tech. And so we find an intersection.

## Sound

A straight line is direct and efficient. It is also not the most scenic path through life. Though of course not actually a sound wave, we often see straight lines associated next to some very sad events next to hospital beds, and hear the incessent, unwavering single sound that is represented.

In other words, it is a metaphor for an absence of life.

In more words, all these oscillilations could be represented as sound waves. We all have our own sound. Its the human side that makes us living.

Here’s mine, visualised:

- oscillation between the above categories
  - frontend back, slow

Note that how I believe each oscillation actually increases in amplitude. Experience is cumulative.

Going back and forth is not a negative thing. It is part of growing and it makes us more informed for the next wave.
