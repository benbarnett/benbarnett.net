<p>A week or so ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/benpbarnett/status/293777151084347392">tweeted</a> about a trend I've been referring to as 'animate on arrival.' Since then I've been seeing more and more of them, and a) wanted to write about it because I haven't written in a while, and b) compile a list of them.
The reason it caught my attention is that without realising, it really made me focus on the content and actually <em>read</em> the thing. To demonstrate, I've listed a few decent examples below and I'm also keeping the others I find <a href="https://delicious.com/benpbarnett/animateonarrival">tagged on Delicious</a>.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Apart from all being beautifully designed ― the top 3 particularly ― they were all launched within a few weeks of each other, got quite a bit of attention and of course all featured this technique.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really like it, and if you're using jQuery just drop in <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/">jQuery Waypoint</a>, add a class to trigger your CSS animations, SVG fills or whatever and everyone's laughing.</p>
<p>And that's that.</p>
