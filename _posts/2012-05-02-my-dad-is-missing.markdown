I don't usually use this space for personal musings, but this is an important one to me. My Dad has been missing for a month now, leaving his house in Surrey on April 2nd, and his car was found in Cornwall one week later, although it could've been there since the day he left.

Realistically, he could be anywhere by now and we know nothing of his whereabouts or intentions. Please help us spread the word and get his face known to as many people as possible by sharing the link below on your social networks of choice.
