<p>Just a quick note to anyone interested in playing around with the <a href="http://developer.lulu.com/page" target="_blank">Lulu Publication API</a> and Ruby on Rails, the post I wrote a few months ago has been updated to include the recent change of API URLs, and inclusion of the new API Key and Upload Token calls.
To see an <a href="http://www.beforeigrewup.com">example app</a>, check out the <a href="http://www.beforeigrewup.com">free online baby book creator</a>, which has just launched and is written using pretty much the exact code in my post.</p>
<p>Anyway, the updated <a href="/blog/2010/05/19/using-ruby-on-rails-and-the-lulu-publication-api">Rails/Lulu API howto</a> is just a click away.</p>
