Next on the agenda for myself and the people of Brushfire is the launch of our new product, My Purple Turtle.

The website is due to launch in the coming months and will offer users an incredibly fast and low cost solution to getting online. Unlike any other product, its incredibly exciting to see the fruits of our labor start to materialise.

If youre a designer and interested in earning a little extra cash its well worth getting involved. Sign up to the MPT Community to stay tuned.
