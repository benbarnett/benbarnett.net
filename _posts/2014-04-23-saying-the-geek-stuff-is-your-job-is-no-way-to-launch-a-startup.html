<p>As developers in a time where everyone wants their own side project/startup/the next &lt;insert latest cool company here&gt;, this is surely our time to shine. It’s hard not to notice that developers, designers and general ‘web experts’ are becoming increasingly in demand for these sort of things.
</p>
<h3><strong>So this is a good thing?!</strong></h3>
<p>As a web developer in London, frequently I will meet someone who wants their own NextBigThing startup, and a healthy chunk of geek time along with it.</p>
<p>As people who provide a service (make once, sell once) rather than a product (make once, sell many), the only asset we really have is our time. How we use it, charge for it, or give it away pro-bono is up to us.</p>
<p>This is the way of things, and I guess how things will stay. My issue though, especially after reading this ‘<em>using words like blogsite is unacceptable journalism’ </em><a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2014/01/ignorance_of_tech_is_not_an_excuse_journ.html" target="_blank">rant</a>, is this scenario:</p>
<p><strong>In a pub:</strong></p>
<p><em>Them</em>: Hey, so I’ve got this great idea for a music startup.
<em>Me</em>: Cool, I love music. Tell me about it.
<em>Them</em>: Ok so it’s a bit like Spotify, but does x, y and z differently. I also have these great contacts that will help it get ‘out there.’
<em>Me</em>: Sounds cool, let’s chat about it.</p>
<p><strong>At the first meeting (…probably in a pub):</strong></p>
<p><em>Them</em>: So yeah, the reason I asked you is because I only want to do this with someone who’s really into music.
<em>Me</em>: Definitely. Any thoughts on how we should put this thing together?
<em>Them</em>: Ha! No idea, that’s your job. I know <strong>nothing </strong>about this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>…right.</p>
<p>Firstly, the hypocrisy of this whole scenario is a little frustrating. Mandating that you’ll only work with someone who’s into your stuff, when you’re not interested in even dipping a toe into how your potential business partner might work is… suboptimal.</p>
<p>Ambition, aspiration and hard work are (so I’m told) essential when it comes to building a company, but shoulder-shrugging about the very platform you’re building it on seems naive. I understand that most partnerships have complementary skillsets, but surely some overlap is important.</p>
<p>If you genuinely want to launch a startup that is predominantly on-the-web, then wouldn’t it be wise to know a little bit about it?</p>
