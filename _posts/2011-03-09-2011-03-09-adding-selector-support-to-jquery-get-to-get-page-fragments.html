<p>Just wrote a little plugin whilst working on a project because I keep finding myself using this functionality and having to write a handler in my application code. This plugin can be dropped in, just like <a href="http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/">jQuery Animate Enhanced</a> and weighs in at less than 1KB, and it will enable you to quickly grab a partial or fragment of the AJAX endpoint.
Here's some dummy code:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/862066.js"> </script></p>
<p>There's not really much more I can say about this. Its unobtrusive, light weight and will simply hand over to the native jQuery.get() method if no selector is supplied.</p>
