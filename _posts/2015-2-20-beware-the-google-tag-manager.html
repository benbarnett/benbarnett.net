<p>GTM. The equivalent of spending years crafting a rocket to Mars, and then allowing someone to steer it from their Playstation at home.</p>

<p>Worse, they can inject new logic, even rewire the engine itself, whilst the people on the rocket are blissfully unaware they've been re-routed to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The person on the Playstation may well be a genius, but if the people on the rocket aren't told when they've added, say, 'experimental fuel saving measures', things <em>could</em> go bad.</p>

<p>Yes, it's clever. Yes, you don't need an engineer to update your tracking tags. But the ability to add <strong>huge</strong> lumps of potentially untested functionality that is nowhere near the rest of your codebase, is simply too much (or little) control. It is the WYSIWYG CMS of analytics.</p>

<p>In case you weren't aware (I wasn't), GTM will override all targeted <code>click</code> events in the DOM. It'll kill the original event, do its tracking, and then create a new event from scratch. If GTM is instructed to open links in a new window, it'll kill the <code>click</code> event, open a new <code>about:blank</code> window, and then <code>window.href = ''</code> it to the URL.</p>

<p>So if you do any sort of <code>click</code> event stuff yourself, its possible for it to be <code>return false</code>'d and stopped dead in its tracks, should GTM fancy. </p>

<p>This means your links don't work. On production. Because code you don't know about has been back alley'd in.</p>

<p>Beware the communication gap! Beware the GTM!</p>
