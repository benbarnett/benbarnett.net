Last month, I did the Olympic Distance London Triathlon 2018. This was by far the biggest sporting thing I’ve ever done and I loved it.

I started training in April this year. I have shed north of 20kg through healthy eating and of course lots of running, cycling & swimming. 

It has inspired me to enter the [Leicester Half Marathon](http://leicestermarathon.org.uk/) in October, and the half Iron distance [Cotswold 113 triathlon](https://www.113events.com/cotswold-113/) in June 2019.

The training has got to a stage now where I genuinely enjoy doing it and long may that continue. I particularly enjoyed the variety of the training – if you were tired from one discipline, often one of the others will still be very doable. I found I could cram in 5 activities a week.

I gratefully received many tips from more seasoned triathletes along the way. I am under no illusion that without these, I may have run out of steam and almost definitely not enjoyed it as much as I did.

And so here they are, for any budding triathletes¹ like I was:

- the first five minutes of the swim, you will be out of breath. You’re not panicking, your body is just adjusting to the environment (thanks to staff at [Shepperton Swim Lake](http://www.sheppertonopenwaterswim.co.uk/) for this one)

- for transition, pack each discipline’s stuff in a separate bag. Even just a carrier back to separate them

- practice running after cycling, just keep going for 1k or so and you’ll loosen up

- be like Superman in the water, your wetsuit will help you glide and save energy

- if your mood goes, eat something; this is often the first indicator of hunger

- having a triathlon watch (I have a Garmin), syncing to Strava and thus breaking things down into small segments that you can work on is a huge motivator



¹ yes, I now only refer to myself as a 'triathlete'
