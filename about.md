I am a ~~twenty~~ thirty something year old web designer based in London. This is my blog about personal stories on both client and personal projects, with which I hope to share some of the techniques and thoughts. Right now I'm working with the government helping out with building progressively enhanced, accessible websites for everyone across the UK.

Iâ€™ve created and launched several of my own ideas.These have all been great technical exercises, and its been really rewarding to see some of the ideas on here be [taken](/2010/06/04/export-svg-from-raphael-js-to-create-a-png-bitmap) [further](http://github.com/jspies/raphael.serialize) by the readers. One idea I'm currently working on is an online baby book creator, Before I Grew up which integrates with the brilliant Lulu, whom as a result have made me [their featured developer](http://developer.lulu.com/page/APP_Gallery). Sadly this product has been discontinued after four successful years of trading.

Another is using an [SVG driven Tube Map](https://github.com/benbarnett/svg-tube-map), which can be viewed over on the [playground](http://playground.benbarnett.net/svg-tube-map/). Someone has even made a whole estate agency based on this.

I find new ways of doing things fascinating and thrive from learning new skills.
